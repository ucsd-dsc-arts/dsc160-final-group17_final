## Abstract

(10 points) 

Our generative art project is a computationally-generated inspired work of Andy Warhol's Shot Marilyns (1964). Andy Warhol's Shot Marilyns is a collection of multiple Marilyn Monroes. They are all the exact same images of Marilyn Monroe except that each one has a different color filter. Instead of creating each of the different color filters through hand, we will be using the algorithm of style transfer. Style transfer is a concept introduced in 2015. The data we will need will be the subject we will eventually choose and other artworks with the styles we want to base the subject off. After running the algorithm multiple times with different style sources, we should be able to replicate something similar to Shot Marilyns. Since it's a digital generated work, we are fine with it just being presentable through digital means. There is the fear that this algorithm will be very difficult to understand, but there are many resources online so we hope we will be able to manage it.

Style transfer is a concept introduced in class. We are expanding it by using it to replicate a popular pop art. We want to do this because we want to see if we can recreate modern art with modern technology.

## Data and Model

(10 points) 

In the final submission, this section will describe both the data you use for this project and any pre-existing models/neural nets. For each you should provide the name, a textual description, and a link. If there is a paper (for neural net) link that as well.
- Such and such Neural Net. The short description of this neural net. 
  - [link to code]().
  - [Title of Paper with Link](). 
- Training data. Short description of training data including bibliographic info. [link to data]().

## Code

(20 points)

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for: 

- code for data acquisition/scraping
- code for preprocessing
- training code (if appropriate)
- generative methods

Link each of these items to your .ipynb or .py files within this seection, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

(30 points) 

This section should summarize your results and will embed links to documentation to significant outputs. This should document both process and show artistic results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your generative art idea. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally innovative?
- How does your generative computational approach differ from traditional art/music/cultural production? 
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- What are the ethical concerns for this form of generative art? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

All references to papers, techniques, previous work, repositories you used should be collected at the bottom:
- Papers
- Repositories
- Blog posts
